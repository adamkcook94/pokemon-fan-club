### Features

### Home

The home page contains an interactive navigation bar where users can hover over each link and have a hover effect, where
the text jumps and turns from blue to white. 

The home page also displays the very eye-catching Pokemon logo which, when the page loads will slide from the right in 
order to add to the environment of Pokemon where a common theme is to throw a pokeball. The background image is also 
every Pokemon of the original 151 facing the user, which adds to a welcoming theme, where the idea is to welcome users
to the fan club.
